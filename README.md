# Workout Sequence Timer
Simple sequence timer to use for home workouts

Inspiration came from Timer-Tab -> [https://www.timer-tab.com/](https://www.timer-tab.com/)

## Short Description
Set up multiple timers that will start sequencially one after another.

## Use-Case
Use case is doing home workouts. There you do various exercises one after another with a small pause time in between.

So let's say you want to do the following exercises in your workout:
1) Jumping Jack
2) Knee bends
3) Crunches
4) Lunge
5) Puschup
6) Trizep-Dips
7) Superman
8) Scissor Kicks
9) High Knees
10) Planck

Every exercise you want to do 45sec long and after that a small 15sec pause. So you can set that up with two timers that will be repeated.

## Technical
